Each of these examples builds on the previous ones, and the initial
block tells you what's changed from last time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Added a config file, people.cfg which just contains

in: people.csv format=csv 

And a people.csv file with a bunch of stuff about some people... feel
free to add yourself and some friends to it!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

With no other configuration, grinder just converts the input file
to XML. It creates a <g:row>  for every row in the table and a tag 
inside that for each column. It uses the first row to get the names
of the columns. These can't contain spaces or other weird characters
so a column title of "My Column!" becomes <g:my-column>

First set the path to the libraries (this isn't necisary if the CSV
perl module is installed on your machine already, but we bundle it
with the Grinder download to save messing around)

export PATH=$PATH:/Users/cjg/Projects/Grinder/bin/
export PERLLIB=/Users/cjg/Projects/Grinder/perl_lib/
Where this is the path to the perl_lib which came with RDF-Grinder, and
likewise for bin

Now you can see the output from your CSV file:

grinder --config people.cfg

Almost all the configuration file options are also available via 
the command line. Run grinder with --help for a list.
