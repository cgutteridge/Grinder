Added to XSL:

    xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"

          <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person" />
 
          <foaf:name>
            <xsl:value-of select='people:given-name' />
            <xsl:text> </xsl:text>
            <xsl:value-of select='people:family-name' />
          </foaf:name>

          <xsl:if test='people:tel/text()'>
             <foaf:phone rdf:resource='tel:{people:tel}' />
          </xsl:if>


----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this step we add some initial triples. First of all is a very 
simple one which says this resource is rdf:type foaf:Person (nb. we 
can't use the foaf:Person abbreviation inside an rdf:resource. This is
because rdf+xml is annoying. A short cut for this is to change the 
<rdf:Description> to be <foaf:Person> instead. This is shorter and 
easier to read, but not necissary so it's ommitted in these examples.

The <foaf:name> predicate means we've had to add xmlns:foaf to the top
of the file.

In the previous example we used {people:id} inside the rdf:about 
attribute. To get values when not inside attributes, we have to use
the more verbose form of <xsl:value-of select="people:id" />. In the 
example above we've had to use <xsl:text> to put a space between the
parts of the name. This is because the block started with a tag, not
text, and XSLT then treats it a bit differently and ignores whitespace.

Not everybody has a phone number so we use xsl:if to check it first. 
Phone numbers have their own URI scheme (tel:) so we declare them as
a resource, not a literal.

== RDF+XML & XSLT shortcuts

You could change the <rdf:Description> block to:

        <foaf:Person 
		rdf:about="http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/example-things/people/{people:id}"
		foaf:name="{people:given-name} {people:family-name}"
	>
          <xsl:if test='people:tel/text()'>
             <foaf:phone rdf:resource='tel:{people:tel}' />
          </xsl:if>
        </foaf:Person>

(you can't put the foaf:phone in an attribute, because we need to put 
the xsl:if around it)

This is shorter but we'll not use it in these examples as it introduces
more complexity. It's in people.xsl.shortcuts if you want a look. You
can override the XSLT file used by grinder:

../../bin/grinder --config people.cfg  --xslt people.xsl.shortcuts
