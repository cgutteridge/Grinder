This example introduces "backwards" predicates that refer to the topic 
of the row, rather than the other way around.

Specifically foaf:member which relates a group to a member. All the 
triples we've create so far were relating the person to a thing, this
is the opposite.

Note the use of the 'mediawiki' tag to convert the name to the value
used on dbpedia URIs (well, converts " " to "_").

Note we have to generate the URI of the person again here. In more
complex examples it may be worth using <xsl:variable> to define it
once at the top of the bit which processes each row.

In the XSLT, we use {../people:id} to get to the ID of the person
as our context inside the for-each is the tags that are the subject
of the loop which are one 'deeper' in the XML tree.
