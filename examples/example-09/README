Added to Config:

delineator: people:likes-eating=;
process: people:likes-eating=tag

Added to XSLT:

    xmlns:myns="http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/example-ns/"

          <xsl:for-each select='people:likes-eating'>
             <myns:likes-eating>
                <rdf:Description rdf:about='http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/example-things/food/{./@tag}'>
                   <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/example-ns/Food" />
                   <rdf:label><xsl:value-of select='.' /></rdf:label>
                </rdf:Description>
             </myns:likes-eating>
          </xsl:for-each>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This example adds a delineator to the likes-eating field. This means
we get one XML tag for each item. Adding this to the config:

delineator: people:likes-eating=;

Changes the XML output (passed to XSLT) 

from...

<people:likes-eating>Cheese;Ham;Fish and Chips</people:likes-eating>

to...

<people:likes-eating>Cheese</people:likes-eating>
<people:likes-eating>Ham</people:likes-eating>
<people:likes-eating>Fish and Chips</people:likes-eating>

Which means we can use <xsl:for-each> in the XSL to loop over it.

We use a processing directive:

process: likes-eating=tag

To give us a sanitised version of the food name we can use in a
URI for it:

<people:likes-eating tag='Cheese'>Cheese</people:likes-eating>
<people:likes-eating tag='Ham'>Ham</people:likes-eating>
<people:likes-eating tag='FishAndChips'>Fish and Chips</people:likes-eating>

Which we can get at using the /@tag syntax. Note that inside the 
loop the 'current' XML tag is now the <people:likes-eating> tag (well,
each one in turn), and not the <people:row>. 

We use myns:likes-eating to describe what someone likes eating. FOAF
doesn't define this so we've invented this in our own namespace. We
also give each food URI a label and a type. Note we've added an xmlns
at the top of the XSLT file.

Because "Cheese" is repeated by more than one person row, the 
resulting data actually ends up repeating the triples for the label &
type of cheese. If you want to clean this up, a command line tool
called "rapper" can do this fairly easily.
